## Can TURTLE GAMES boost sales performance by analysing their customer data?

This project was about diving deep into customer and sales data for a fictitious global gaming company, TURTLE GAMES. As part of a team of analysts, my role was to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that could help TURTLE GAMES make data-driven decisions to improve sales performance and customer engagement.

I began by cleaning and preparing the data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and Excel, ensuring it was well-structured for analysis. From there, I applied exploratory, descriptive, and diagnostic analysis in both Python and R to identify key trends in customer spending, demographics, and engagement. One of my main focuses was predictive modelling, where I used Simple and Multiple Linear Regression to examine how factors like age, income, and loyalty scores influenced customer spending. Later, I fine-tuned these predictions using Decision Tree Regression, which improved the modelâ€™s ability to predict customer loyalty accumulation.

The second part my analysis involved customer segmentation. Using K-Means Clustering, I grouped customers based on income and spending behaviour, helping TURTLE GAMESâ€™ marketing team identify high-value customer segments.This segmentation provided insights into which customer groups were more likely to engage with the brand and which products resonated with different demographics.

To complement the numerical analysis, I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) using TextBlob to analyse customer review sentiment. After cleaning the text data, I classified reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, identifying key customer satisfaction trends. I also generated word clouds to highlight commonly used words in different sentiment categories and analysed the top 20 most positive and negative reviews to understand what customers appreciated or disliked about TURTLE GAMESâ€™ products.

This project provided hands-on experience with machine learning models, statistical analysis, and NLP techniques, while reinforcing my ability to apply both Python and R in a business context. More importantly, it showed me how data can be leveraged not just to analyse past behaviours, but to predict and influence future decisions, enabling companies like TURTLE GAMES to make more informed, data-driven choices.
